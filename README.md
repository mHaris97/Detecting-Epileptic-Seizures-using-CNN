# Detecting Epileptic Seizures From EEG Data using CNN

In this project we work on an open source dataset, from MIT, which contained Electroencephalographic (EEG) readings of epileptic patients labelled with time stamps for seizures. We worked on a very simple, Computer Vision inspired, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to get a satisfactory level of accuracy for classification of the three phases of a seizure: pre-ictal (one hour before a seizure), ictal (during) and interictal (between two seizures).
